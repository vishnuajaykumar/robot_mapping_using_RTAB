This project involves using RTAB-Map, a real-time appearance-based SLAM algorithm, to build a 3D map of an environment. RTAB-Map relies on a bag-of-words approach to recognize previously visited locations (loop closures), which helps correct drift and improve the mapâ€™s accuracy. By detecting these loop closures and updating the global map accordingly, the system can create a more robust and consistent representation of the environment in real time.
